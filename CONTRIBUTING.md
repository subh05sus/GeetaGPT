## :zap: Guidelines 🔑 

1. Welcome to this repository.
2. Participants / contributors have to **comment** on issues they would like to work on, and mentors or the PA will assign you.
3. Issues will be assigned on a **first-come, first-serve basis.**
4. Participants / contributors can also **open their issues** using [issue_template], but it needs to be verified and labelled by a mentor or PA. Please discuss with the team once before opening your issues. We respect all your contributions, whether it is an Issue or a Pull Request.
5. When you raise a issue, make sure you get it assigned to you, before you start working on that project.
6. Each participant / contributor will be **assigned 1 issue (max)** at a time to work.
7. Participants are expected to follow **project guidelines** and **coding style**. **Structured code** is one of our top priority.
8. Don't create issues that are **already listed**.
9. Please don't pick up an issue already assigned to someone else. Work on the issues after it gets **assigned to you**.
10. Make sure you **discuss issues** before working on the issue.
11. Pull requests will be merged after being **reviewed** by a mentor or PA.
12. It might take **a day or two** to review your pull request. Please have patience and be nice.
13. Always create a pull request from a **branch** other than `main`.
14. Participants / contributors have to complete issues before the decided Deadline. If you fail to make a PR within the deadline, then the issue will be assigned to another person in the queue.
15. While making PRs, don't forget to **add a description** of your work.
16. Include issue number (Fixes:issuenumber) in your commit message while creating a pull request.
